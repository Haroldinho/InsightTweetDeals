# InsightTweetDeals

## Description:
63% of customers expect companies to offer customer service via their social media channels. (Source: Smart Insights) To stay relevant, many retailers communicate new deals and offerings to their customers via social media (e.g.: Youtube, Instagram, Twitter…). 
It presents a unique opportunity to analyze different products offered online in a centralized fashion. 
At Insight, I am building a framework to compare the prices of different products over time from historic Twitter data. 
<b>This tool will enable businesses to compare their offerings against their competitors over time and more precisely target their advertising campaign by seeing what has and hasn’t worked in the past.</b>
